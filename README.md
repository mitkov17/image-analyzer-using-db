# Image Analyzer Application

The Image Analyzer Application is a full-stack application for uploading and analyzing images using AWS S3 and AWS Rekognition. The application includes a backend RESTful API and a frontend Angular application for interaction.

## Features
- Upload images to AWS S3.
- Analyze images using AWS Rekognition.
- Search images by keywords detected in their labels.
- View uploaded images in a gallery.

## Backend setup 

1. Configure the application:
   - Open the `runApplication.bat` file in the root directory.
   - Replace the placeholders with your actual AWS credentials, S3 bucket name, and your actual database credentials:
     ```bat
     @echo off

     set BUCKET_NAME=<your-bucket-name>
     set ACCESS_KEY=<your-access-key>
     set SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
     set AWS_REGION=<your-region>
     set DB_URL=<your-url>
     set DB_USERNAME=<your-username>
     set DB_PASSWORD=<your-password>

     java -jar target/aws-image-analyzer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
     ```

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project's root directory (where the pom.xml file is located). Then build the project using Maven:
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   runApplication.bat
   ```
- By default, the backend will run on http://localhost:8080.

   ```
   
3. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash

   ```

4. Install dependencies:
